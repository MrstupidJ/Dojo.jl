## General notations
- O is the origin of the frame
- CA is the center of mass of body A
- PA is a point attached to body A
- _W corresponds to the world frame
- _A corresponds to the A frame 
- CA_W is the center of mass of body A expressed in the world frame 


## Body notations
Body A's state is represented by 
- x = CA_W 3 dimensional position of the center of mass of body A expressed in the world frame W.
- v = V(CA, A / W)_W 3 dimensional velocity of the CA attached to body A with respect to the world frame W expressed in the world frame W.
- q = RWA quaternion representing the rotation from body A' frame to the world frame W, e.g. P_W = RWA * P_A. RWA is the matrix form of q.
- phi = Omega(A/W)_A angular velocity of body A with respect to the world frame, expressed in body A's frame.
